\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
$ $Recipe Buddy is a modern recipe sharing website intended to facilitate connections between our users with food and culinary arts.
It creates a personalized experience for the user, showcases popular and trending recipes, and creates a community through various recipe sharing services.$ $

\section{Document Conventions}
$ $The SRS document has the following conventions:$ $
\subsection{Lists}
$ $Lists and sublists should be formatted as such:
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is an entry on a list!
    \item This is another entry on a list.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item This is an entry on a nested list!
              \item This is another entry on a nested list.
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item And this is an item on a doubly nested list.
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Lists should never be nested more than twice.
The list in this section shows how far we allow our lists to go.
Anything more than that is not allowed.

\subsection{Revisions}
After a new revision, it is important to log your progress.
Please update this document's version number and update this document's Revision History table.

\subsection{Styling}
When updating this document, adhere to the following style guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first paragraph of each section or subsection does not need to be indented.
          Subsequent paragraphs should be indented.
          In LaTeX, that is done by default by typing two blank spaces ``\ \ " after a paragraph.
    \item This document should be typed using the default LaTeX font and styling.
    \item When writing numbers within a paragraph:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Whole numbers between zero and fifteen should be typed alphaetically.
              \item Whole numbers equal to or above 16 should be typed numerically.
              \item Decimal numbers, such as 3.14, should be typed numerically.
              \item Fractions should be typed in the form {$\frac{1}{2}$}.
                    In LaTeX, this can be done using the following code:
                    \\ \texttt{ \{\$ \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\} \$\} }
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code}
When writing code within a paragraph:
\begin{itemize}
\item For short snippets, it is okay to use inline code. For example: \\
The Python command \texttt{ print( ... ) } writes to standard output. \\
In LaTeX, this is done using the \texttt{ \textbackslash texttt\{ \} } command in-line with the rest of a paragraph.
\item For longer snippets, please give the code its own block. For example: \\
The following Python function will calculate the area of a circle: \\
\begin {verbatim}
import math

// This function takes in the radius of a circle
// and returns the area of that circle.
def area_circle(radius):

r_squared = radius ** 2
return math.pi * r_squared
\end{verbatim}
This can be done by using a \texttt{ verbatim } block in LaTeX.  

Please remember that this is a requirements document, and not the system's documentation!
Remember to only use code in this document when it is needed!
That is,
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write code that clearly illustrates what you are doing.
    \item Write code that is concise.
    \item Explain what your code is doing such that a reader with minimal technical skill can understand what the code is doing.
    \item If the code takes too long to explain, save it for the system's documentation.
    \item Try not to take up more than half of a page with a block of code.
    \item Never take up more than an entire page with a block of code.
    \item Aim to have minimal overlap between the code in this document and the code in our system's documentation.
    \item The code in this document must convey meaningful information to all readers.
          It should be useful for developers, as well as non-developers.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
$ $

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
$ $This document is aimed at a wide audience:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recipe Buddy developers should be able to go over this document to understand how the system functions.
          Developers should have the ability to use this in conjunction with the system's documentation to gain a comprehensive understanding of the system's underlying features and overall design.
          Developers should also be able to use this document to understand who to design this system for and why the system is designed the way it is.
          That way, with each new proposed update to Recipe Buddy, developers can assess if it would align with the system's design philosphy.
    \item Recipe Buddy designers and clients should be able to go over this document to understand how the system is designed.
          With any proposed updates or revisions to the system, designers should have the ability to refer to this document and ensure such changes align with Recipe Buddy's design philosophy.
\end{itemize}
$ $

\section{Project Scope}

developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the 
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific 
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual 
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety Requirements}
$<$Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or 
harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or 
actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to 
any external policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the 
product’s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be 
satisfied.$>$

\section{Security Requirements}
$<$Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use 
of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define 
any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or 
regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any 
security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.$>$

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
$<$Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be 
important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: 
adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, 
maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, 
and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when 
possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, 
such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\section{Business Rules}
$<$List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or 
roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not 
functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional 
requirements to enforce the rules.$>$

\chapter{Other Requirements}
$<$Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS.\@ This might 
include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal 
requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections 
that are pertinent to the project.$>$

\section{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
$<$Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including 
acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans 
multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to 
a single project in each SRS.$>$

\section{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow 
diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship 
diagrams.$>$

\section{Appendix C: To Be Determined List}
$<$Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain 
in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.$>$
